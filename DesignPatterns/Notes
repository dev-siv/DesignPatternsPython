# SOLID:

S - Single Responsibility Principle


O - Open Closed Principle


L - Liskov Substitution Principle


I - Interface Segregation Principle


D - Dependency Inversion Principle

Single Responsibility Principle:
---------------------------------
A class should have just one purpose. This prevents developers from creating god objects.

Class should have only one reason to change.

Open Closed Principle:
----------------------
Open for extension but closed for modification

Interface Segregation Principle:
-------------------------------
Idea is here simple , you do not want to implement/link too many methods to an interface.

Dependency Inversion Principle:
-------------------------------
High level modules or classes should not depend on low leve modules. Instead they should 
depend on abstractions.
