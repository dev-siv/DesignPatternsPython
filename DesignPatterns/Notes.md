# SOLID:

S - Single Responsibility Principle


O - Open Closed Principle


L - Liskov Substitution Principle


I - Interface Segregation Principle


D - Dependency Inversion Principle

Single Responsibility Principle:
---------------------------------
A class should have just one purpose. This prevents developers from creating god objects.

Class should have only one reason to change.

Open Closed Principle:
----------------------
Open for extension but closed for modification

## Liskov Substitution Principle:
The Liskov substitution principle states that a child class must be substitutable for its parent class. Liskov substitution principle aims to ensure that the child class can assume the place of its parent class without causing any errors.

Interface Segregation Principle:
-------------------------------
Idea is here simple , you do not want to implement/link too many methods to an interface.

Dependency Inversion Principle:
-------------------------------
High level modules or classes should not depend on low leve modules. Instead they should 
depend on abstractions.
